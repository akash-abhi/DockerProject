#RISE 2020.4.4.1

--------------------------------------
Description:
  Software developers specially for student who are learning and testing their projects they have to spend
  lots of time in set up all the environment and do manually one by one. It sometimes discourage them a lot.
  Thats why I created this project with the help of docker and create a infrastructure. So that any one can
  set up their environmnet in just one step via use of python program "project_tui_handler.py". This is 
  interactive program in python which allows users to do all the setup in interactive manner without knowing
  the commands and background details. Use it and upgrade it. 
--------------------------------------

Finally, I created my Docker Project with world record holder and world best mentor Mr. Vimal Daga Sir.

In this project, I use multi-tier architecture in docker.

 -> Use of "wordpress:5.1.1-php7.3-apache" image for launch our server and website
 -> Use of "mysql:5.7" image for as backend storage database
 -> Create "docker-compose.yml" file to integrate docker infrastructure with the use of docker-compose
 -> Create "project_tui_handler.py" for developers and user so that any one can easily use my project

In Repository I paste some screenshots to display the working of my project.

I like to thanks Vimal Sir to guide me to create this interactive and cool project.
